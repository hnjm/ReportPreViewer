# Report(Pre)Viewer
Report(Pre)Viewer allows you to quickly and easily preview Microsoft .rdlc reports.

## Why?
Sure, you have the [ReportViewer Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms251671.aspx), and I think it's great (after all this app is built on it), but you need to:
1. create a Visual Studio project, 
2. put the control on a form, 
3. point it to a report, 
4. set up your data sources, 
5. set up data bindings, 
6. define data sets, 
7. and then run the app. 

Need a new report? Back to square 3. Need to tweak the data? Back to square 6. Need to change the report? Well, you get the idea.

**Report(Pre)Viewer** helps you avoid all these step.

## How?

Load the app, point it to an `.rdlc` file, tell it where and how to get the data for the report and you're done.

Need to tweak the data? A click away. Need to select a different report? A click away. Made changes to the report and need to see the results? Click one button.
